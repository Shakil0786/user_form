# user_form
This was my first task of my internship at Bharat Intern as a full stack developer.  "Developed an innovative registration form for Bharat intern, optimizing data collection and enhancing user engagement. Utilized front-end technologies including HTML, CSS, Nodejs and Mongodb to create a dynamic and seamless registration experience."
